# Barrel-OS
Barrel OS is a simple operating system created with COSMOS.

# How to run
To run Barrel OS, simply download an easy to use tool called RUFUS.

Insert a USB drive, and then run RUFUS.

Rufus should automatically detect the USB drive and should be selected.

Set the Filesystem to FAT32, and choose the Downloaded Barrel OS ISO as your ISO image to flash onto the USB.

Then click ready. Read the warning message, and click OK when you are ready. It will write. 

When it is done writing, safely eject the usb and and plug it in to your PC. 

Depending on what PC you use, there should be a BIOS key. If you PC is on, turn it off. when the USB is still in, turn on your PC and immediatley start pressing the BIOS key.

After that, just look for a place to boot from USB. If you don't find it, then simply shutdown your computer, turn it back on again, but this time press the BIOS key that directly goes to the boot order. From there, select the USB drive and hit enter. You should see Barrel OS booted up.
